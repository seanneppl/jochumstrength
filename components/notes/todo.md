## Updates

UPDATE DEPENDENCIES!!!

1. Deleting users: 'On the users side I know we talked about having it done, but I still don't seem to be able to do it and that's actually deleting users!'

* This isn't possible without the firebase admin SDK.

2. More organized user sorting: 'The active/inactive is nice (other than it seems to be flipped - active users pop up on the inactive list) but it's still getting pretty full.'

* User search sort

4. Programs folders: 'Finally with programs it would be awesome to create Folders so let's say all of my "back in action" programs phases 1 - 4 can be in a folder, reason for this being is the list of programs is going to get crazy long other wise!'
