### Paypal Pay and sign-up or pay through app.
Payment on the site and seemless sign up (they pay and are able to sign in) so if you can continue to look into the best ways to do this that'd be awesome.

I'm game for what your idea on the two landing pages to get them to sign up, I'd like to see your design and set up for it all! The video I'd like to have on the landing page on the wix website is one of me introing them to the site and showing them everything it can do so I'll get to work on having that created!

How do I view their diet and weight sheets from the user menu? Doesn't appear as if I can do that yet.

For Both I'd love a cover photo as well, just like we do with the lifting but a picture of a guy walking on a scale and a picture of a bunch of healthy foods for the diet sheet! Really makes it look nice!
