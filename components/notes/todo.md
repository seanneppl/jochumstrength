The workout check ins: so when they type in what they have done for an exercise and check it complete I'm not seeing these results when I go to their program. Am I doing this wrong? Is this something that's still being worked on.

### Paypal Pay and sign-up or pay through app.
Payment on the site and seemless sign up (they pay and are able to sign in) so if you can continue to look into the best ways to do this that'd be awesome.

It'd be really awesome to send the same message to multiple clients at once. I do weekly check ups and to send the same general weekly check up message to get conversation going before is really going to be a key trait. Again trying to make sure everything is scaleable.
