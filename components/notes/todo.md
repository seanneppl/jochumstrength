# ToDo

### Major
1. Home page

1. Cache the userProgram so it's accessible offline.
1. Look into firebase offline use.
1. add redirects if the authUser id in the route doens't exist???
1. same for home page??

### UI
1. consistent headings on each page
1. style footer
1. Links should be modals. To keep users on the programs.
1. fix time to first paint. Aka have items prerendered to dom without dummy data. while the real data is being store. Aka limit { data && <element>} patterns.

### Minor
1. form validation - remove button disables ???
1. Home page has a greeting message from admin
1. Rename days in createProgram ???
1. Remove (can't remove user ) / freeze user.
1. Add exercise id to the tracking. So if down the line they can track based on exercise?
1. Should the users program be firebase.workouts(uid).on() so it isn't interupted if it's updated while they're using it?

### Testing

### Styling
1. Change background everything back to white.
1. All components into cards???

### Landing Page:
 1. Would like to edit this and be able to bring customers that havent signed up yet to this page and show them what they'd be getting if they signed up. I think this will be easier to discuss in person when you get back!

### Diet Sheet:
1. We will want to add snacks
1. Don't want to lock after the day of as some people add in their diets at the end of the week each week!

### New User Sign Up:
1. We will want to find a way for when someone signs up to either just allow them to have access but no program until I send it over or some other solution!

When Creating a "New Day" on a new program I'd like the default day to be in the set up of a normal day. Currently it is only like 4 exercises and the set up is goofed up which forces me to have to add a bunch of stuff everytime

### Chat:

### Before Photos:
1. This would also be huge on the Tracking page to have the ability for them to upload their photos so it keeps everything in one spot

### Admin page

Name of Program: So when I give them a default program, I'd like to be able to make small edits to that default program and then name it something else before I send it to them. Currently it looks as if I can only send the defaults with no edits and the same name every time
