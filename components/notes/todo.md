# ToDo

## TODAY

1. Users workout page input success / checkbox?

1. does the program object need to be stored in json???
1. Look into wix / heroku subdomains
1. Make the admin page (admin messages/userlist) vertically mobile responsives
1. separate style sheets
1. Overall styling

## FIX
1. Admin panel mount tab on click.
1. Messages show date / username.
1. WorkoutList add default...
1. Reapply the bootstrap hidden style to the self created ones.

## TODO
1. add font aweseme for symbols???
1. Only mount current tab when it's active. (currently all through mount / load at once)
1. Enable firebase storage direct download. To do this you'll have to enable cors. https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/download-files
1. Can messages be more efficient
1. Reorganize the user-program components. i.e. expandable table
1. Organize component structure into components / pages
1. Messages unread count
1. use memo more often.
1. Cut back on as many firebase calls as possible.

### Security
1. Secure api key / api key usage. This will be easier once jochum has a domain subdomain.

### UI
1. style footer
1. fix time to first paint. Aka have items prerendered to dom without dummy data. while the real data is being store. Aka limit { data && <element>} patterns.

### User Program

For the program page along with the tracking, can we add a check mark thing so they can click and feel accomplished if that makes sense! So they could put in their weight or just click a box that says they did it and it feels good!

### Editing
I'd like to edit are the formatting (Pictures/text/ect) on my own.

### Paypal Pay and sign-up or pay through app.
Payment on the site and seemless sign up (they pay and are able to sign in) so if you can continue to look into the best ways to do this that'd be awesome.

### Design
[Advanced Human Performance](www.Advancedhumanperformance.com)

Iâ€™d love if they signed in and all of the days were closed and had a design on them (maybe for an upper body day it was always a generic ripped Upperbody guy on that bar or something along those lines) and when they click on that it opens up into that days work outs.
