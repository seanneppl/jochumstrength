### UI
1. fix time to first paint. Aka have items prerendered to dom without dummy data. while the real data is being store. Aka limit { data && <element>} patterns.

### User Program
For the program page along with the tracking, can we add a check mark thing so they can click and feel accomplished if that makes sense! So they could put in their weight or just click a box that says they did it and it feels good!

### Paypal Pay and sign-up or pay through app.
Payment on the site and seemless sign up (they pay and are able to sign in) so if you can continue to look into the best ways to do this that'd be awesome.

As for the landing page, whatever you think is the best and easiest way to make it look really good, I trust you! Things I can think of using are the transformation photos we've already had and any sweet stock photos you find! Really just want to make it look nice and have all the information clean for them! (Cleaner than the current one we have, really want to make it look professional!)

I also plan on having a buddy of mine making a couple videos of the website and functionality, that's probably something we'd want on this page isn't it, now that I'm thinking about it? What do you think? Interested in your thoughts here as this landing page will be important for getting people to actually get into the site that we spent all this time one!
