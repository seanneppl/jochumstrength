1. Can messages be more efficient
1. Reorganize the user-program components. i.e. expandable table
1. Organize component structure into components / pages
1. Messages unread count
1. use memo more often.
1. Cut back on as many firebase calls as possible.

### User Program
For the program page along with the tracking, can we add a check mark thing so they can click and feel accomplished if that makes sense! So they could put in their weight or just click a box that says they did it and it feels good!

### Paypal Pay and sign-up or pay through app.
Payment on the site and seemless sign up (they pay and are able to sign in) so if you can continue to look into the best ways to do this that'd be awesome.


I'm game for what your idea on the two landing pages to get them to sign up, I'd like to see your design and set up for it all! The video I'd like to have on the landing page on the wix website is one of me introing them to the site and showing them everything it can do so I'll get to work on having that created!
