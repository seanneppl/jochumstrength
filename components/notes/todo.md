# ToDo

### Major

1. Remove sign-up form from home page? Move it into a modal within the users page.
1. So johcum sets ups the accounts and the users can change the passwords once theyre ready.
1. emails don't need to be verified if austin sets them up.
1. copy the landing page.
1. Messages page - part of navbar with message badges.
1. Leave a check in today button as well as check in on date?
1. So users can check in when they want to and put the date they want to check in on.
1. Restyle admin table. - Responsiveness? Where to put tracking data? Copy list group from usertable?
1. if there is no localstorage for tasks in the searchbar make sure to load them.

### UI
1. consistent headings on each page
1. style footer
1. fix time to first paint. Aka have items prerendered to dom without dummy data. while the real data is being store. Aka limit { data && <element>} patterns.

### Minor
1. Rename days in createProgram ???
1. Add exercise id to the tracking. So if down the line they can track based on exercise?
1. Look into firebase offline use.
1. add redirects if the authUser id in the route doens't exist???
1. same for home page??

### Landing Page:
 1. Would like to edit this and be able to bring customers that havent signed up yet to this page and show them what they'd be getting if they signed up. I think this will be easier to discuss in person when you get back!

 [Landing Page Info](https://www.jochumstrength.com/program-information)

 1. As for the landing page I'd like it to be similar to this https://www.jochumstrength.com/program-information so when a new user goes there they can see this , I'm also thinking we could add the paypal button onto the website, I was able to do it on wix, I'm assuming you can do it on this website? Not sure but let me know, after seeing this website I think this should really be the landing,selling and program page if we could, let me know if I'm making sense here. I could eventually see this turning into just our base website but thats for the future

### Diet Sheet:
1. Don't want to lock after the day of as some people add in their diets at the end of the week each week!

### New User Sign Up:
1. I'm thinking of the best way to do the new user sign up. Like I'm not sure how much sense it makes to allow a user that hasn't paid to create an account, I feel like that could cause some confusion? Would like to know your thoughts.
1. Remove sign-up form from home page. Move it into a modal within the users page.
1. So johcum sets ups the accounts and the users can change the passwords once theyre ready.
1. emails don't need to be verified if austins sets them up.

### Chat:
1. slack api ? or just use firebase (maybe split database)

### Before Photos:
1. This would also be huge on the Tracking page to have the ability for them to upload their photos so it keeps everything in one spot

As for information to store, name and birthday and sign up date maybe? Not super important though as they sign up through paypal right now which gives all of that aswell.

As for logos and stuff, I'm going to make you an editor of our current website and in the file storage thing on the website it should have everything you'd need and let me know if you need anything else
